# Unicode Security Guide

Welcome to the _Unicode Security Guide_! This guide has been designed to give Web application developers, software engineers, and application security researchers a reference for understanding Unicode-related security issues in operating systems, applications, and the Web.

The dynamics of Unicode, and character encodings in general, are often misunderstood or poorly implemented, and lead to an array of interesting if not catastrophic security vulnerabilities.

The content here has been sourced through testing, research, and the following two technical reports from the Unicode Consortium:

* [Technical Report #36 : Unicode Security Considerations](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr36/)
* [Technical Report #39 : Unicode Security Mechanisms](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/)

Beyond these two sources, further research has been ongoing around identifying and inventorying software behaviors.  Test cases are being provided in the <a href="https://github.com/cweb/unicode-security-guide">source code repository</a>.
